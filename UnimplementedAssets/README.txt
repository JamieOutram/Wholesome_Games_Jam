This Folder is for holding all art and assets that have yet to be implemented in the unity project. 
Commit & push Changes to this folder to the Art branch and they will be merged and moved to Assets folder when needed in the unity project.
(I (Jamie) Tend to make a bit of a mess in the Assets folder whilst programming and this'll avoid merge conflicts and lost files)
