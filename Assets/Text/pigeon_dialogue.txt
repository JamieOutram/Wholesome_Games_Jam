Oh, hello!

I'm Pigeon Lindbergh III but you can call me Pidge.

-----  <------- (INDICATES NEW SPEECH BUBBLE)

You got up this high all by yourself?

For a small cat, you are amazing! 

-----

I'm actually afraid of heights.

And this is as high as I like to be.

Hi, it's Pidge again here!

-----

Oh? You also hate heights but hate giving up more?

You're so inspiring!

-----

I need to try harder as well.

Next time you see me hopefully I can be a little braver.
